This project was created over the June holiday in 2022 for computing project.
I decided to go for this project since I wanted to discover how API works and get the fundemental exposure of taking on such project.
It took many attempt to get it working since it isn't a conventional python project and required a comprehensive understanding of how to properly use an API.

This project is about using open-source Gmail API provided my Google in a python file to read mails in Gmail with specific key words and automatically write it to Excel.
