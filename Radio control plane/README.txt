As a mean to test my mechanic skills, I decided to join a competition about making plane.
After one competition, I was hooked to aviation and begin my journey of a plane fanatic.
I research on plane designs, avionics, and history of planes from that events onward.
To this day I still have passion on this fields and hopefully, I can make an impact in this fieldd one day.
